## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images and MP3 objects from the Digital Public Library of America (https://dp.la)

Arizona is a beautiful state, rich in history, and is ready to be explored. This project, “A Visual Postcard of Arizona’s Historical Sites”, connects four collections which highlight the impact they had on shaping the history of Arizona. These locations show their cultural and geographical significance while providing historical context, in addition to emphasizing the physical attributes of the sites. We welcome you to explore the Coronado Trail, Mission San Xavier del Bac, Fort Defiance, and the Grand Canyon! 

## Collection History

The Coronado Trail is the first Federal Highway in the United States. It connected the state in ways never before seen and is a way to view the beauty Arizona has to offer. The Coronado Trail follows the path theorized to have been used by Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in 1540 as he searched for the fabled “Seven Cities of Cibola.” (Coronado Trail, n.d.). Digital resources from this collection may include images from along the trail, a map of the trail, images of wildlife, and historic markers.

The San Xavier del Bac Mission is also known as the “White Dove of the Desert”, is located in Tucson Arizona on the Tohono O’odham Nation Indian Reservation. The mission was founded by Padre Eusebio Kino (Father Kino) in 1692. The mission continues to serve people today as a place of worship and sanctuary. Digital resources from this collection include images of the inside and outside of the Mission.

The Grand Canyon is considered one of the most iconic and most visited sites in Arizona. The historical, cultural, and geographical significance of the Grand Canyon make it a perfect addition to the visual postcard of historic Arizona. Digital resources from this collection include images of the Grand Canyon, sounds of wildlife, and a map.

Many outposts, camps, and forts were built to protect settlers and communities from outlaws and Indigenous communities. One example of this is the Fort Defiance collection. Fort Defiance is in Apache County near the New Mexicoborder. Digital resources for this collection include images of the Fort.
